# Erdos-Quant-Finance-project

## Executive summary

In this repository are the four mini projects required to complete the Erdos Institute Quantitative Finance bootcamp of Summer 2025. A summary of each and the key learnings obtained are as follows.

### Project 1

In this project, our task is to construct two potentially profitable portfolios, comprising whatever stocks we like and subject to whatever constraints we like, where one portfolio is higher risk and the other lower risk. Our determination of risk will be the (historical) sample standard deviation of the (log) return on investments, measured over a x year period, normalised to yearly.
